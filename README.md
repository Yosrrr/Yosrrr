# 👋 Hi, I’m Yosr Sbaii

### 🎓 Data Science & AI Engineering Student | Passionate about Healthcare, ML, Vision & Interactive Systems

I am a final-year engineering student in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** with hands-on experience across **machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, data engineering**, and **interactive 3D systems**. I build intelligent and impactful systems — from predictive models and medical imaging analysis to Unity3D applications and multimodal AI pipelines.

I enjoy solving real-world problems by combining **data, algorithms, and software** to create solutions that are both technically robust and user-focused. I thrive in collaborative environments and continuously seek to learn new technologies, experiment, and deliver high-quality work.
